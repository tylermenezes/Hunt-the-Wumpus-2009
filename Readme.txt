This is a demo of the Graphics, World, and Controls of the game. 
While most of the game logic and AI exists, it cannot be demoed without collision detection/compass 
and the various entities, which are to be created next.

It features an animated charecter sprite(dynamic entity) and a collection of block sprites (static entity).
It also features a fully functional camera and controls, integrated properly via the World class(es).

To control the charecter use the mouse to turn the charecter and use the 'w' key to move forward.
Use the 's' key to move backward. The camera will follo the charecter when he reaches an edge.
Navigate the charecter around and view the various boxes.

TODO: add more entities, collision detection, and a background.
